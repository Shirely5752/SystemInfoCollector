# SystemInfoCollector
The SystemInfoCollector script is designed to gather and save detailed system information and manage specified services on a Linux system. It collects CPU model, available RAM, current IPv4 addresses, and running processes. Additionally, it clones a GitHub repository, lists subdirectories and Markdown files, searches for occurrences of the term "override," checks the status of specified services, and commits any changes back to the repository. This script is ideal for system administrators and developers who need to automate the collection of system data and service management tasks.
